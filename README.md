# Compile All VMFs
This simple python script gets all avaliable .vmf files in the same directory and compiles them one after the other.

There are a few customisable options to set the correct paths for your Half-Life 2 directory as well as the target directory for the bsps

This script uses threading to compile maps at the same time to ensure it finishes faster. Certain errors are caught and displayed at the end of execution.
